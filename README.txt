# Traffic Light Controller

## Description
This project involves the design and implementation of a hardware-based traffic light controller using LEDs. The LEDs are set up on a breadboard with resistors and are driven by the Basys 3 PMODs. The system utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to control the sequencing of the traffic lights, effectively simulating real-world traffic control systems.

## Key Contributions
- **FSM Logic Development:** Created the finite state machine logic to manage the state transitions of the traffic lights, ensuring accurate timing and sequencing.
- **Breadboard Configuration:** Configured and connected the LEDs with appropriate resistors on a breadboard to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
- **FPGA Hardware Interfacing:** Utilized Basys 3 PMODs to drive the LEDs, showcasing hands-on experience with FPGA hardware interfacing and real-time signal control.
- **Digital Circuit Design Knowledge:** Gained practical knowledge in digital circuit design and implementation through this hands-on project.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** Basys 3 FPGA Board, LEDs, Resistors, Breadboard
- **Languages:** VHDL or Verilog (depending on your implementation)
- **Tools:** Xilinx Vivado (or any relevant development software)
